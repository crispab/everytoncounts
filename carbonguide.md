# Carbon reduction guide
(This is a living document, we'll keep evolving it as we learn)

## What is my carbon footprint?
Statistically, your personal carbon footprint is in the range [3-18 tons](http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg3/ipcc_wg3_ar5_technical-summary.pdf) CO2eq per year depending on income level.

The following factors put you on the upper end of the scale (there's more, but these are the biggest factors for most people):

* How much you fly
* How much you drive (non-electric)
* How dirty your region's electricity is. See [ElectricityMap.org](https://www.electricitymap.org). Green is good, brown/black is bad.
* How much meat you eat (especially beef)

Based on this you should be be able to estimate your approximate footprint. Note that the upper limit 18 tons is an average. Every [4 passenger-flight hours corresponds to 1 ton](http://www.carbonindependent.org/sources_aviation.html), so if you take your whole family across the world for vacation, that one trip could bring you up 40+ tons. 

Sample calculation:
* [Article: Did the math on my contribution to global warming](https://blog.crisp.se/2016/12/12/henrikkniberg/did-the-math-on-my-contribution-to-global-warming)

There are also plenty of more detailed [carbon footprint calculators](https://www.google.se/?q=carbon+footprint+calculator#safe=active&q=carbon+footprint+calculator) if you prefer.  

## Change personal habits to reduce CO2
* Eat less meat, especially beef
* Fly less, replace with train when feasible (replacing plance with car for the same distance makes no difference, unless it is electric). Rule of thumb: Avoid flying when you can, offset it when you can't.
* Drive less (if you have a fuel car), replace with bike or train or walking (if feasible of course...).

## Buy to reduce CO2
(or ask your employer to buy)

* Buy an electric car, or a hybrid
* Buy solar panels

## Pay to reduce CO2 
(or ask your employer to pay)

* [GoClimateNeutral.org](https://en.goclimateneutral.org/) - pay a monthly fee, and they buy carbon offsets. They continuously research to find the most effect ways of offsetting.

## Invest to reduce CO2
(or ask your employer to invest)

* [Trine](https://www.jointrine.com) - Crowdinvest in solar panels in Africa, help people get electricity, reduce CO2, and get your money back with interest. Note that the effectiveness (in terms of CO2 reduction per €) varies quite a lot from project to project. Do the math, the numbers are clearly visible for each project. Divide the total investment amount by the expected CO2 reduction. The best projects are at 20€/ton or lower. 
* [BrightSunday.com](http://www.brightsunday.com) - Finance solar panels in various parts of the world. The difference from Trine is Bright Sunday is more aimed at companies, with larger recurring transactions, as opposed to the smaller one-off investments for Trine.
